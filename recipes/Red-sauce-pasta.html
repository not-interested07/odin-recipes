            This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.

                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.

                    Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.

                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.

                    Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.
