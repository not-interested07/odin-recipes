                    <p><b>How to make it?</b></p>

                    <ol>
                    <li>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. </li>
                    <li>Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). </li>
                    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. </li>
                    <li>Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.</li>

                    <p><b>How many layers does lasagna have?</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            We can opt for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish.

                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Assemble as outlined but do not bake. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Thaw frozen lasagna completely before baking.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Let chilled lasagna sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to baking. Add an additional 10 minutes to covered baking time.

                    <li>
                        To reheat leftover lasagna: Place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes.
