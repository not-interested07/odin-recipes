                <p><b>How to Peel, Seed, and Chop Butternut Squash</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cut the squash in half crosswise, separating the "bulb" from the "tube." Slice the stem and the bottom of the bulb off and stand both pieces on a flat surface.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the skin from top to bottom. Once both are peeled, cut each piece in half, scoop out the seeds, and chop.

                    <p>
                        <b>Tip:</b>Some reviewers suggest using the microwave to soften the skin prior to peeling. To do so, simply use a fork to poke holes in the squash and pop the whole squash microwave for 2-3 minutes. Then follow the above steps for peeling.
